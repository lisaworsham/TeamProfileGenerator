# Template Engine - Employee Summary

The purpose of this homework was to create a command line application to build a software engineering team and display it in a HTML webpage to work on writing code that is readable, reliable, and maintainable. There was code already preexisting as well as a series of test that I had to run and pass.


## Prerequisites

Visual Studio Code was used to build. NodeJS was used to generate the command line application. In the terminal, user will need to do a **NPM install** to ensure commands will run. Then input **node app.js** to run the application.

## Process/What was Changed

I reviewed the provided code to see what I needed to do in order to complete it. There were several js files that had tests to complete so I decided to start there. I started on Employee first, since it was the parent, and Manager, Engineer and Intern all depended on that one. A super constructor was the best way to handle what was needed to be done. Also, the tests were for this part of the code so I wanted to make sure they were all passing. Once that was setup, I moved on to the functions that would generate the command line prompts. This time starting with Manager and going to Engineer and then intern. Finally, I had to finish it with generating the HTML webpage with the all the answers the user would input with the generate command lines.

## Review

Overall, I enjoyed this assignment. It was a bit daunting at first with all the code but once I got a handle of what it was asking of me, it got easier. It was hard but enjoyable.
